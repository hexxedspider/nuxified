extensions - community based commands for nuxified, which you can download from the marketplace command (once implemented).

it would take from the verified repos from the llc (nuxified discord server), and allow users to download them and automatically go into the extensions folder.

this is the template for how your commands should look:
"""

# import discord, asyncio, (etc libraries needed)
# from discord.ext import commands

# HELP_TEXT = {
#     "category":
#     {
#         "command <args>": "description"
#         "command <args>": "description"
#     }
# }

# class example:
#     def __init__(self, bot):
#         self.bot = bot

#     async def cmd_example(self, message, command_args):
#         await self.bot.send_and_clean(message.channel, "this is an example command")

# def setup(bot):
#     return example(bot), HELP_TEXT
